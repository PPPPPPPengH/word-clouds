trump when he withheld military support to ukraine biden plans to call on lawmakers to approve more arms and humanitarian aid for ukraine while appealing to americans to brace themselves for economic hardships resulting from the conflict   glory to ukraine putinisawarcriminal     the reason the americans are silent is because he has achieved his goal to make ukraine fight with russia and to impose economic sanctions on russia and of course making europe dependent on it the us can now provoke china               but putin will wipe out ukraine and then move on the nato countries we will

thats why he didnt go to pl but to ukraine hope they can figure out a way of a military intervention without triggering the nato alliance case     but ukraine chose the path to join a terrorist nexus nato now paying the price  they wanted russian children killed by american missiles but what happened is other way around let them lick self inflicted wounds  if we allow ukraine to fall into putins

everyone worldwar3 stop provoking ukraine  zelensky  i am an american puppet and they made me rich  i let nato use ukraine as their battlefield in their unnecessary war with russia  i think ukraine had delusional ambitions propped up by empty promises from the west but theres a core ethnos there who have as much right as any to their own country  and he got elected by his people with this damn ukraine really doesnt wanna be russian   can the leadership avoid the pressure to get militarily involved in ukraineim hoping so since the slovenia consulate was bombed in ukraine and since they are a member of natodoes that give nato members an excuse to help out ukraine more like creating nfz etc i support ukraine that simple so other things to unravel with all of this right now its about the

around ukraine it doesnt draw the line around cuba   by making this nato vs russia it is no longer russia vs sister ukraine attacking family has played badly in russia why nato wants to keep vs ukraine considering how its been going and hope estonia is right on russias military resources  yes though i unfortunately think putin is so committed to this that he will level ukraine to ash and kill hundreds of thousands of civilians just to win even if it bankrupts his entire country   ive found it on several usbased eshops all owned by one company so im posting just one link   but it doesnt seem like the proceeds would go to support ukraine treason a texan trump supporter goes to russia to help them take on ukraine       luckily i have this to teach my children about russia and the ukraine god bless her because if they where members of the eu they automatically belong to nato this means that both nato and the eu could physically help ukraine and putin would have to withdraw

ukraine i remember being a junior in high school 20132014 and watching the news every morning in my ap government class we watched the tensions rise between russia and ukraine then this has been an ongoing issue for decades but now everyone caresanywho better late than never   is vladimir putin committing war crimes likely but calling him out is unlikely to stop him observers say   via     wasnt only  that canceled the season  had a split role in that too do not lump me as a fan into your agenda maybe we can get everyones salary out to ukraine to help people that actually need it losers

psycopath who kill or jail his critics so you are implying ukraine has no right to join nato and eu like latvia lithuania and estonia did in the past and that putin doesnt want former ussr countries to join eu tyranny theres a lot of things that i regret today but one of the most prominent ones is that i didnt get to see all the cities in ukraine before they were bombed and destroyed by russia
