  yeah rite putin knows that biden is the weakest president hes ever had to deal with  we might have made a bigger deal about malaysian air flight 17 last time putin got frisky  putin invaded and took over the rep party and never even fired a shot the ominous signs along russias border that may reveal putins next move  reports    and putin wins again unbelievable   so was putin savvy a genius or both   i was ranting to my wife about this todayhow can the party that reveres reagan the way they do sit by and not only not condemn it but openly root for putin  wtaf  have i officially dropped into the upside down   unsure of what trump would dotranslation putin was scared of trump   what a contrast with putins vitriol the ukraine invasion is unjust and saying this will cause reflection to many unjust seizure of anothers land now is all the time we have and ukrainians need help now many of us can only free citizens are in jeopardy of a communist takeover putin claims crimea size bites  timed to coincide with each escalation from putin just like the usafutile to impose maximum sanctions immediately leaving nothing in reserveunless the objective is to leave putin with nothing left to lose  well youre missing the ability to understand written text how can a former president claim that something wouldnt happen if he were still in this position but supports putin invading ukraine calling something clever doesnt mean supporting it but recognizing strategy   now we are back to being dependent on nations that hate us for oil putin is making money hand over fist because the price of a barrel of oil was so now near 100 dont encourage people like putin draw some lines   joe and hunter are totally compromised by russia who let them walk into crimea putins intention round up jail or even execute dissidents and religious and ethnic minorities is crimes against humanity 200000 jews are directly targetedthank biden     your father was a sage voice on foreign affairs and nowhere more so than on russiaputin the gop has completely lost its way and lost its mind    whos our enemy putin didnt release the wu flu no one has flown into our buildings in the name of putin no dead american service members by putin no one wearing suicide vests screaming allah akputin hes done nothing wrong in my eyes   putin never effected my life in a negative way putins puppet    do you do anything but tweet bullshit all day gym who pulled our troops out of ukraine who spent 4 years giving putin handjobs wasnt a democrat sad thing is you know it but just like ohio state you ignore it youre pathetic    if i am understanding your text correctly and the gross putin flag in your handle fuck right off   but the crisis could spark a nuclear war no winners as everyone would be dead it would be better if putin agreed to have peace talks   you sound like putin i guess thats a compliment  putin has already put chunky money in his pocket your daily reminder that the         amp every other republican is actively working with our enemy putin while simultaneously attacking america i would remind putin of afghanistan they took over the country but month after month year after year it became too expensive to maintain i predict the same will happen here russia will likely take over ukraine but i really have doubts they can hold it russiansputin is only semiblessed like alanand semicursedthats why putin had a hard lifeand cant enjoy more beachdamn those blessedwe will strafe the lakes bays coves and beachesputin is upset the blessed are weaklings who have it easy can biden sink any lower with putins help he can  lunch alert    at       does the republican party remember who or what they stand for anymore well the answer is no they dont now they stand for putin and trump  ive read like 15 different pieces on why putin wants to invade and take over ukraine and gotta be honest i still dont get it risk reward here doesnt make sense this guy lives in an alternate reality  what a moron putin has made a fool of biden   putins dangerous achilles heel exposed  russian leaders entire system in crisis smartnews       he was saying that putin is taking advantage of bidens weakness and that it would have never happened under trump opinion im a former moscow correspondent dont let vladimir putin fool yourussias war in ukraine is only about one thing  barrons   putin has a trail of war crimes in syria chechnya and ukraine which he needs to be punished for think milosevic and the hague       hmmmm you are right cause he did whatever putin said and then he tried to say president biden and his son were involved in russia if that were true then why is he against russia right now and why is imposing sanctions against them huh ask yourself that   fuck you putin  lol the fat lying grifter youre sucking up to is literally in love with putin and would have given him alaska if hed asked for it  sounds like something putin would like trump has just praised putin as a genius the conspiracy theory is now a historical fact       there is no honor among thievesputin blackmailed biden of us military aid to ukraine since 2009ukraine corruption between poroshenko biden and putin has made ukraine the poorest nation in europeadditional 200m went to putindates highlighted    one paid by putin hey trump i want to lower my property taxes how do i do that the iraq war alone outweighs all of putins aggressions combined the greatest crime of aggression by far in the 21st century by the roguest rogue state of them all with no consequences for the liars responsible and theres a lot more where that came from a diabolical and frightening putin     bought and paid for by putin  if putin moves he will take the russophone parts of eastern ukraine why rule over bankrupt catholic ukes  poland can have those what a disgrace you are biden is doing a great job amp your former president praised putin haniyt is a hack amp a fascist     putin is responding to the will of the russian people to intervene in a civil war in the donbas which has been ongoing for years  painting him as a kgb goon is counterproductive and illustrates exactly why we have difficulties in the region heres a guy who was tough on putin  lmaooooooo yall still on the trump train are dumber than a bag of hammers how dare joe biden walk away after a speech and not take any questions yall can fuck all the way off buncha nitwits     maddy im sitting back here thinking did russia actually put trump in office forget the 2020 election how was the 2016 election influenced by the russians trump

idolize putin go there and be his puppet  and take the trump family with you  i think its time for putin to learn a lesson biden needs to send him a hard lesson  day late and a dollar short  pooty putin is going in  because putin knows trump much better putin laments the loss of the last one that did hes trying to create it again   amc what is the next move for joe   putin is jumping rope

conflicti am sure you will now correct your newsletter   ukraine is a democrat regime scam to distract from their policies causing skyrocketing prices crime rates and illegals flooding over the

crisis   via    trump is like a russian his boss is putin correction putin is dealing with the rothschild side    youre giving navy intel a bad name brother theres an argument to be made here but an i

their irrational fear of the orange boogeyman they praise putin if the gop were run the way it was 40 years ago these clowns wouldve been run out of the party by now  you need unity in america so that putin doesnt have reason to identify any party of america as independent and goes in to superate the country this is mind war and military is there to threaten the weak you need to play their own

world is watching i was an adult when reagan and the entire  spent time and resources warning the world against russia now the reactionary right would have you believe putin is a teddy bear we should be playing with goptraitorstodemocracy   you dont want to go to war with russia because the usa taking on the role of world police has led to great tragedy abroad and at home for no real benefit i dont because im a kgb plant and beatnik hippie wants america nuked and hopes for the ussr to come backpraise putin   so your delusional argument is that putin didnt invade ukraine under because  trump  putin was pleased  with trumps agenda and he took crimea under obamabiden and is taking more under bidenharris because  putin was busy playing with puppet trump  except for the part where putin is actually dealing with a dementia patientthats why its so easy for him  hope putin talks to him like he questioned his head of intelligence trumps putin genius praise sure makes him sound like a russian agent   wow 28milion could die if this happens dam putin crazy     listen marco putin is building its deadly military quickly  he is taking over real estate and building his army manpower  if we let him take ukraine europe is dead poland and the baltics understandand are screaming  with new technical military assets manpower its over  since our incumbent govt is funded by putin and in return they have sanctioned him with a series of meaningless gestures i think we would open up the gates and invite putin to give us the donetsk treatment before any of us had a chance to show any solidarity and patriotism oh yeah  has putin shaking in his boots        gtsmart and gtgood are not mutually exclusive things trump called what putin did smart and then called what he did bad that is what the entire last paragraph is about   putin will not stop with the ukraine he wants to recreate the whole old eastern bloc my friend in romania is terrified about time someone slipped mr putin some risin     putin has moved into areas held by rebel forces these rebels dont want to be part of ukraine they wish to annex themselves to russia he has no need for war these guys want to join him

amp8220helpamp8221 repel ukrainian army     my guess is the germans still hope to have some leverage to maybe push putin back into the kennel someone needs to hold putin down and force him to smoke a bowl he needs to chill out   putins macho seems sketchy amp contrived especially riding around on horseback wout a shirt in cold russia to prove his masculinity  its amazing that some see him as a heman paradigm when he really looks like a wimp hed likely never survive our military basic training and acting tough to putin will require great effort because we are talking about a guy putin who has a black belt in judo   josh hawley provides aid and comfort to putin kansas city star alleges   traitor opinion  tucker carlson goes it alone on putin  politico   reading his appeal directly to russian citizens somehow has been the most chilling thing for me thus far putin needs to be removed whether just from office or this earth i dont give a fuck he is malignant     you represents the trumpcult and it is pure demonic evil jeremiah 179 i heard a historian today compare putins speech to hitlers speech of 38 about czechoslovakia and he was spot on what you continue to push on so many

support of the president but fighting abroad to draw attention away from problems at home have rarely worked for putin     fareed zakaria this was the best response to putin  do you know why trump admires putinbecause vladimir putin has been in power for over two decades and could remain so until 2036  the difference is that the people putin is doing this to didnt do anything to deserve it vladimir putin speaks fluent russian german and english joe biden can barely speak englishusausausa   what makes you think that putin doesnt speak english friendly advice you may consider googling

invasion of ukraine to insure it you senator blackburn congressman green and others in the tennessee gop are afraid to disagree publicly with trump what a shame vladimir putin felt donald trump would punch him right back if russia launched invasion   if putin were at our southern border trump would call him a genius and offer him a penthouse in trump tower these commentators dont acknowledge the

bloodshed if people die its down to washington  do you also think its a coincidence that extremists started popping up after trump became president think its a coincidence republicans are sticking up

secret documents trump stole from the wh this is just intellectually dishonest oil prices did jump driving up prices at the pump as a result of russiaukraine situation nothing she says here suggests shes retroactively blaming inflation on putin     may the good angels be with you against the great satan  putin  omg and now a press editor is comparing the right to invade iraq to the right to

war in case putin does decide complete takeover like his crazy speech suggested 34 of ukraine will fall in 34 days not enough to call reservists that will mean a lot of civilian and military casualties  putin be like   russias military capabilities the returning sense of moral righteousness lessons learned from past mistakes amp a close alliance wchina could mean that the west which chose the role of an adversary will start being reasonable even if not all the time     no putin is trying to restore the russian empire in his legacy the opposite will be that putin was the one losing ukraine on his watch opinion somebody needs to give putin a history  lesson    its your fault for voting in a demented old fool in to office putin can smell the piss filled diaper of biden  the republican support of putin is astonishingwhy do the republicans love putin its cool to think putin is bad which is all the more reason why we usa and nato should absolutely not be poking that bear rn   is this statement misinformation  under trump we had low gas prices  low inflation lowest unemployment and putin didnt dare make a move   there is absolutely nothing you can stand on without looking like an idiot putins wars  drawing red lines has gotten considerably more difficult in the last 20 years it used to be that you could say if you cross my border you have launched an invasion of my country or if you attack me you have declared war   hate that i now associate the shapeless one w vladimir putin    isnt putin an imperialist dictator in a fascist country famous for their lgbtq oppression and killing of journalists that is right now invading another country for territorial expansion i wonder if ukrainian  separatists asking putin for support realize that russians will never leave might explain why hes so slow to punish putin why did he skip his security detail amp visit lebedevs villa    putin and exactly who is this broad again       you obviously rushed to wrong conclusion what trump meanthe praised putin because biden is weak and eu are so dependent on russia fuel it was tactically right and you got admit trump was right like he was right years ago in clip i posted to you putin is a threat to world peace amp should b treated as such im sure there were politicians who were afraid of global ramifications amp economic risks of defeating hitler or any leader who was a threat to humanity but often benefits outweigh the risks how many must die 1st    essentially thanks to a handful of thugs 10s of thousands of lives will be lost thanks to putin i long to wish to see anyone other than these governments in power no one trusts no one and its how we end up here no one but a small handful of people what this  hot take it would be irrational for putin not

vladimir putins backside like tsar nicholas i says defence secretary    like when putin put bounties on us military heads amp nothing not one damn thing was done but that vile creature 45 called him up and it was shits amp giggles between them  sub or bottom to putin  poland is in nato i believe thered be a war and for that reason i dont see putin doing that christopher titus  armageddon update  gop guardians of putin   via     here is the fox strong leader on 7162018 stating his fealty to putin  fox is engaging in sabotage of the ukraine for putin    hard passnot interested in hearing asshats support putin dis president biden and gaslight if trump knows putin so well why doesnt he persuade him not to bomb a sovereign nation this is a good read    video asked if he may have underestimated putin biden stares blankly picks his teeth   we are different but that is not a reason to be enemies he said in an emotional addreess for the first time he admitted that putin has authorised an invasion which could burn everything down senile biden macron humiliated by putin trudeau forced to withdraw his emergency law because he is politically isolated klausschwab who is agitated in the media to vaccinate everyone do you still want to obey that shit stand up peoples stand up young people   trump and other top conservatives rally to putins side as he threatens ukraine   im appalled by the impending slaughter of countless ukrainians under putin russia is a fascist state they murder opponents and if there was anti war demo in moscow the people in whose name this godforsaken state was formed would be arrested stand by ukraine       i dont think ive ever known anyone take such a one sided view to world events im surprised youre an euphile because if the situation in ukraine is so one sided its surprising so many eu countries allowed themselves to be beholden to putins oils and gas  it is foolish to underestimate your adversaryputin is without question and smart and dangerous opponentthe biden administration looks like a bunch of bumbling freshman polisci majors  texas is a nightmare for women and trans kids the fucking world is melting and we still keep pumping gas and putin wants the ussr back i got more but ill stop there   wrongputin wants the war if nato doesnt retreathe wanted written guarantees the answer was nonow he takes matters in his own hands  and siding with putin  yikes dont be fooled why putin wants a lot more than ukraine     you must have missed tfg totally embarrassing us in finland while he kissed putins ass ask your buddies the russians what they were saying about trump after that conference theyll tell you right after they stop laughing ukrainewar former secretary of state mike pompeo says he has respect for vladimir putin and donald trump says that putin is a genius it has been said our words define us  this is trueyou cannot get the blood off your hands using soap and water    putin called the usas bluff     i think putins doing a fine job of that all by himself  no inventing needed  putin just marcus halld biden and bidens dont you dare do anything before thursday   this guy is joking right  vladimir putin is not afraid of joe biden no one is joe biden is a laughing stock   the protests served as a national awakening establishing ukraines democratic credentials and setting the country on a path that diverged sharply from the increasing authoritarianism of putins russia in the sixteen years since the orange revolution leaders of two ukrainian breakaway regions ask putin for help kremlin   via  and  goes over how us export controls will force putin to prioritize russias strategic technological interests  how can tucker ask what has putin ever done to medoesnt tucker have investment in the stock market or drive a car putin is screwing all of us financially thats besides being a murderous megalomaniac  putins 1 hour rant on tv considered an invasion im a former moscow correspondent dont let vladimir putin fool you russias war in ukraine is only about one thing   i will vote very carefully and get these  insurrectionist putin lovin democracy hatin white supremacy a h gone bye bye    putin needs to be silenced donbass republics ask putin for military help  rt russia amp former soviet union   shouldnt the russian military be just a little cautious and unsure of how crazy fuked in the mind is their supreme commander vladamir putinnot too late to rebel    v putin looks sick puffy features and other symptoms suggest uncontrolled diabetes cancer or tertiary syphilis is he trying to establish a legacy before he is out of time is it a napoleonic complex affecting his personality ask mental health professionals  what does putin have on murdoch  sweetie  your boss wanted the usa to leave nato weakening the west your guy held up support for ukraine your guy just called putin a genius for invading ukraine  dont tell me he would have stopped this ukraine president says he tried to call russian president vladimir putin   share on twitter   donald wouldnt punch anybody he wouldnt someone else to do it and never putin  a forced agreement is only way putin will stop  ukraine goes with nato will be wwiii  ive begun to think there must be some sort of murdochputin alliance for real  trump and the gop have been putins tool to weaken americas strength and resolve to defend democracy and the rule of law and to pave the way to destroy democracy in ukraine since july of 2016   these people pretend that russian calls for imperialismirredentism cyber attacks proping up corrupt politiciansoligarchs and military invasionsoccupations among other things all happened after nato expanded all this started before putins reign and before nato expanded   so  if biden called putin a genius you would have said he was tough  its not that putin is being hesitant with his decision its more hes just loving all this worldwide attention focused solely on him he loves this more than actually starting it hes clearly not right upstairs     lots have tried putin literally poisons them  even if they have fled into exile that was something stalin used to do  honestly laurence youre a jokefuck ukraineyou dont care about our allyis that coz you support putini can only think this bizarre stance of yours rakes in the moneyyou have no integrity no principlesyoure vileyour poor kids coercive control is now a crime putin is the most hated person in the entire world right now he is a piece of garbage karma is coming his way only a matter of timemy thoughts and prayers are with the wonderful people of ukrainestay strong amp god bless standwithukraine  i dont really trust that the gop has any idea what weakness looks like to putin putin   are you trying to win some kind of award for whatabouteryif anyone gave money to the conservative party in the hope it would change the governments stance on russia they will be feeling disappointed but putins lot can still revel in momentum and useful idiot corbyn  putin confirmed ingroup   you didnt even ask him about trump praising putin grow a pair of fucking balls jake marco rubio has zero credibility on this issue after 4 years of silence in the face of trump obsequiousness to vladimir putin you bring shame to the good journalists of your network as i have said i suspected before  is on putins payroll as is his boss     in my 40ish yrs of being a republicanr at heart turned i the weakest thing i have seen is the party reject all their principlesmoralsethics amp constitution in order to embrace trumptrumpism the way they embrace putin ties them more to traitor status as of jan 6th  even sadder that a major american political party is actively supporting vladimir putin over our own president and major american news outlets cant seem to bring themselves to mention it what accounts for putins assertiveness on ukraine   doesnt seem that putin is impressed by those sanctions i am afraid tomorrow is the day we find out again that appeasement never works    um yeahputin knows hes dealing with a pos who showered with his daughter animal abusing lying sack of crap no wonder putin has been emboldenedhe actually has the high ground  russia doesnt nato is hardly a threat to it however democratic slavic countries on the border on russia are a problem for putin  pretty sure trump didnt give a shit about what putin was doing he was making friends with him what he did for a fact while in office was much worse than the democratic collusion sadly in the end youre really all the exact same players on the exact same team i think republicanstrump believe the putin model will work for them here claim mexico presents a security threat and they wont address concerns immigration then invade for a land grabcreation of a large border zone probably at least being talked about in elite con circles i have not heard a single america praise putin go eff yourself     there is no one to investigate this since they are all on putins payroll so once again putin has outmanoeuvred the globalist war mongers by recognising the ukraine breakaway states as independent    very costly may be a price worth paying for ukraine by putin more than the us paid in afghanistan over 20 years i dont think so sadly trump got screwed by putun  mr greed himselfhe may see karma once more where the sun dont shine cupp putin is playing trump and fox     nobody is ideologically insulated from another anyway xi definitely drew inspiration from putin soviet remnants seem to be especially relevant in donbass despite putins antileninism and its not seen as detrimental a putin spokesman says russia has never attacked anyone that statement ignores centuries of russian attacks   smartnews  sorry i cant figure out if she means putin isnt critical enough of unvaccinated americans or biden isnt critical enough of putin neither makes any sense but its marsha so biden vs putin in a hell in a cell ppv match july 4th 2022 winner gets ukraine it seems putin runs a huge risk if he launches full scale war wars that didnt go according to plan have brought down many a dictator live white house says it thinks putin is improvising as us official warns russia is ready for an attack  still have to take putin serious china imposed sanctions to taiwan ukraine workers are underpaid doctors during covid flew in poland salarys     why are american corporations still buying advertising on fox and tucker carlsons show putin is democracys  enemy because this is how the lead up to wwii started when germany took sudetenland by force in 1938 fjbunfitpelosi defends bidens sanctions against tyrant putins invasion of ukraine total assault on democracy   genuinely drightening how far russian influence and money has penetrated was this putins plan all along putins idiotic ukraine propaganda undermined by his own people since 2018   time 4 a new reality when diplomacy is powerlessrussias hands should beand will betied 4 any actions obama would be impeached for praising putin at what point will trump be officially  labeled a traitor    embarrassed by putin how has putin embarrassed biden  you are quick to criticize president biden that he is not being tough enough with putin but you are silent about this     as they should be and i hope they still trust us dont know if i would weve already elected a putin stooge as president once amp   almost the entire r party is compromised or openly supporting putin over their own country im just not seeing a happy ending   and sowhat let a dictator rule over the world we will deal with it unless of course your trump with putins money going to his bank accounts maga your a pawn for murdock and putin   putin got his occupation this biden year stay tuned for next year step by stepinch by inch       happy wednesday to all well seems like putin may be on a mission to stir the pot so to speak i was always wondering why he was so quiet if talks fail punishment is in order themanwhowanted2bking putinsucks  trumpputin for those saying trump praised putinplease install whats called shtick recognition softwareyou need ittrump trumpwasright  president biden is savvy and a genius  he hit putin where it hurts  in his wallet  i imagine trumpputin are going to lose a lot of their clout and friends if they cant pay them   no thats the republican party the party of authoritarians to be in the republican party today you have to bow down to trump and putin  i listened with wonderment your question regarding failure because of russias incursion to ukraine im concerned also but your statement played into putins hands would you have told fdr after pearl harbor that he failed the worlds fucked a wish putin wiped these mongs out first     false equivalencyyoure being a useful idiot for putin  they prefer to give money to putin natural gas than to renewables andor nuclear  words fail putin is a killer that the west is imposing sanctions now reflects that they didnt work last time when they were intended to deter putins incursions into ukraine in 2014 alan beattie writes for the financial times     i think it was ukraines only hope of remaining independent thus it made little difference putin is an expansionist dictator and if you know your russian history and his agenda ukraine was always going to be a target following his rearmament programme under the dumb twitter destroys stephen king for comments on putin biden stick to writing horror classics mr the post under the dumb twitter destroys stephen king for comments on putin biden appeared first on sean hannity     putins ninedash line the comedianturnedpresident is seriously in over his head    he didnt praise putin for invading  watch the whole interview  media once again cherry picked info and changed the context  man oh man even though you spent all that time squealing and screeching on the floor about the horror of wearing a mask youre wearing one nowwhat a pathetic hypocritewhen will you find the stones to tell us if you support trumps statement about putin invading ukraine what a contrast with putin pseudohistorical lecture and invocation of a deep nationalism earlier in the week  biden announces that he is the weakest president and that putin can have ukraine this after giving afghanistan to the taliban china do you see  taiwan you can have that too until we reelect a real president putin waits for biden to take officebiden is the worst tough guy everwiright wigov wipolitics wiunion this shit is just bonkers     open smartnews and read its time to admit the obvious donald trump sure is acting like a russian agent here   to read it on the web tap here   meghan mccain my father john mccain warned us about putin we should have listened     actually not its obvious he wouldnt tolerate it and hes established a healthy relationship between him and putin so i dont see why he would  stick to what you know  11 yearolds gangbanging captain tripps is more your thing  protip  obama let putin get a nice bite of the ukraine  oh i get it youre a fiction writerexplains the bull youre spewing  that deal isnt available because putin wants to reestablish the russiansoviet empire  hes said as much for 20 yrs  the only thing that may save the baltics is they did join nato so theres a mutual defense pact     trump set records for the amount of sanctions put on russia plus if putin thought he could get away with it under trump why only do it while obama and biden are in power i hate using absolutes but at this point if youre for compromise after everything that has happened in the past few days you either1 just dont give a shit about ukrainians  or anyone besides yourself really2 are for putin and his fuckin bullshitthats it graham when putin looks at biden he sees neville chamberlain   via  with his praise for putins invasion of ukraine trump makes his apologists look foolish again     listen carefully rich because i am only explaining this once first day in office biden shutdown keystone pipeline and many other sources of petroleum based fuel oil and natural gas the us was producing more than we need and we were selling it around the world putin lost money  thank god for this cabinet or we would have corbyn and abbot ready to take putin on  turn ukraine syria iraq yemen into graveyard for putinassadiran regime axis istandwithukraine       war is coming whether you want it or not the status quo amp appeasement of tyrants no longer an option  trump calls putins moves on ukraine smart and savvy  the washington post    that putin is in his peeper tape  peeing on tfg    im not surprised putin and murdoch are peas in a pod of thuggery  cassad is reporting that the mayor of kharkov igor terekhov  has started making conciliatory statements about russia  so now more afraid of putin than right sector  putin is nothing more than a warmongering asshole  he wants to act like the czars of the world he should work to improve his country not invade his neighbors  please take care putin is the worlds greatest terrorist    in russia theres putin and putin he altered the russian government so he could be president for life republicans on russia crisis its bidens fault just dont ask us how to fix itthe crisis has sharpened the fault lines in the ongoing rift between establishment republicans who want to penalize putin and trumpian populists urging isolationism     it has nothing to do with the people of ukrainenato deep state created a nice enclave in ukraine when hussein was in the office putin took away crimea from them now hes taking away a big chunk of mainland deep state is losing its sht and trying to push all out war zelensky issues plea to russian people after silence from putin  we dont need war  world news   i understand nato members defending each other i dont understand why they cant put polish troops in ukraine as a physical deterrent against russian aggression toward an independent democratic neighbor state that seeks membership in nato sanctions will not deter putin  putin is now dealing with a feeble old man who cant speak correctly or has balls to deal with the world as we speak biden is a clown  putins popularity in russia has increased over the last two months proving that most russians really are horrible people  if you likelove putin and russia so much feel free to move there the rest of us prefer democracy idiotrussianpuppetdisgracetoamerica   putin will love the fact you are divided in the usa  well done  idiots   um whatconservative here and uh fuck putin mkay  why are red republicans like trump praising putin instead of standing with the free world russia takes ukraine china takes tiwan and the republican autocratic party elitist take america     not true putin would have been put in his place if trump were rightfully president   save your criticisms for putin if you are not in ukraine otherwise youre just trying to hurt ukraine and its completely obvious in this moment   dont count on xi jinping  and china supporting putin ukraine  president asks russian people to choose peace ukraina ukraine ukrainecrisis russia putin zelensky    pelosi calls putin a tyrant calls developments stunning ha ha ha the pot calling the kittle black  this is what i was trying to point out to someone yesterday the sanctions are really hitting russia badly putin is hell bent on focusing on things that dont matter eg spending way more on defence the russians living in russia are paying heavily for it  i say have all his bank accounts checked secretly illegally doesnt matter to me sounds like hes been paid off maybe 45s buddy putin handled it for him something just isnt right russian president vladimir putin in address monday from the kremlin delivered a recitation of historical grievances and an unmistakable challenge to the postcold war international order dominated by the west   via  some true things im not pro war putin is a megalomaniac tucker carlson is naive or willfully ignoring history trumps calling putin a genius given the wests flaccid response is an observation and not necessarily praise  why do repubs love russia so much and putin is it  anything but dems mentality    why didnt putin do this when trump was in officeplease explainwhy did putin move into crimea when obama and biden were in office and now when biden is in office this boner going out of his way nightly to tell his enormous audience that putin is not a bad guy is truly awful come get your boy    its as good a theory as any trump  putin  hitler  daddy   also this notion from the maga people that putin is some great strategist should watch those putin interviews that oliver stone did not for the merits of the interviews but to see who putin really is sometimes normal but also quite the buffoon almost trumpian buffoonery  biden set a delicate trap you think putin a former kgb intelligence officer has been outwitted and bamboozled by the mental defective that cant successfully read off of a teleprompter wow i bet you also wear a mask while you masturbate ukraine president says he tried to call russian president vladimir putin      trump and the gop have been putins tool to weaken americas strength and resolve to defend democracy and the rule of law and to pave the way to destroy democracy in ukraine since july of 2016   i praise putin putin the phone down and leaving twitter alone whats putins next move   dont forget both trump amp pompeo know national security secrets amp since they love putin it is likely they will share them with him if they havent already they like the idea of power but dont see that it would make them traitors if they arent already traitorstodemocracy        punish putin hard remember ukrainians are dyingsanctionrussianowstandwithukrainestandwithukraine ukrainenatomemberbudapestmemorandumrussiainvadesukrainecrimeaisukraine   spy t 2 hours to see if ole putin is bluffing  pompeo was right and joe biden is a vegetable no match for putin thanks biden voters you elected a vegetable   so let me get this straightconservatives have gone from supporting reagan who stood up to russia to now supporting trump a man who openly and directly supports putin invading ukraine what am i missing here goptraitorstodemocracy gopbetrayedamerica we could give ukraine offensive capabilities without a single boot on the ground biden touted its use in istan so why not now flailing arms psaki tells about sanctions on putins 3rd cousin and that patience is required bone crushing sanctions are available use them now    opinion david a andelman cnn news  somebody needs to give putina  history lesson   he should definitely be barred along with all the other people like jim jordan and many others trump should not be able to run for any office a treasonous ex president and pompeo for praising putin and there roll in insurrection putin just wants to go into ukraine to kill ukranians and destroy towns to fulfill his ego there is a very good reason we do not allow russia to join nato and his name is putin  yea putin fed up because biden has an impeccable foreign policy record what vladimir putin thinks of donald trump   via  thats all the thoughts i have right now we shall see what happens ultimately i think russia is going for broke they will never get another opportunity like this the balance of forces will continuously trend against moving forward and putin knows it its now or never    everyone knew this was coming an invented manufactured lie for putin to justify an invasion fox and the fascist right wing traitor media will parrot putins line  im going to tell him he is a very bad man  yup thats going to scare putin what basement did you come from to think that would scare one of the most powerful people in the world you may as well go after the hells angels with a diaper on totally out of your league  disasters  like trump capitulating and groveling over putin have weakened our country   you are a traitorous snake  it isnt nato expansion its their existence putin hates ffs corbyn is showing his true colours theres no room for apologists in this thus even a more democratic russia would want to keep belarus ukraine georgia kazakstan amp the rest centralasia under its control thats why any attempt to bring russia onside amp without the putin regime in place would have to involve accepting that fact here is the thing though when the likes of alexeinavalny agree with putin that ukraine amp belarus are part of russia what putin is saying about ukraine is something that nearly all russians actually agree with    you are being obsequious to someone who is obsequious to vladimir putin neville chamberlain would be proud of you history will damn you you are a pathetic weak little man  thanks to the canada convoy we know maga has been organizing on the supply chain in order to slow it down which has worked but not well but theyre cheering putin for a reason perhaps hell help them constrict the us supply chain as part of the payback buckle up jon stewart calls trumps views on putin f bonkers  the independent   why does it smell so bad in moscowthe prime minister has been putin since 1999putin ukrainerussiacrisis  a typically war hungry media is for the moment waitingi think focusing the conversation about the ukrainians ultimately force the hand of the us into conflictthe world is letting the us take the lead no one wants to be the one who checks putin first  who exactly is going to invade russia   estonia  poland or finland   nobody has any such notions  they just want to survive in their own little country and want putin to stay in his 3although ahrar alsham would have made an unlikely partner in such an americanled campaignwhile maybe not joining an american led campaign they seemed to be joining unified campaign against bashar al assadputin puppet who was in danger of losing to rebellion at that time  putin laughs at biden 1 these warnings must be taken very seriously putin and henchmen have a history of assassinations to get rid of important resistance forces in syria they picked off one after another respected leader because people did not take warnings seriously enough   thanks joe biden for the printing of money to cause inflation shutting down pipelines to exacerbate inflation fumbling afghanistan and falling all over yourself and appearing dumbfounded with z a putin and ukraine  also thanks for the great statesman you got for    its not just tucker carlson the fox didnt want him on air it would he would be gone fox is a part of the same conspiracy trump started with putin many years ago as long as you have fox youll never get rid of autocratic intentions of ruling this country too much money involved     so your american leaders are just as evil as russias leaders is what you are saying i am a refugee from a cia coup in greece so excuse me while i cheer on putin who unlike biden is not starving afghanistanis to death like evil biden go cheer another war you caused i wont  no ones praising putin theyre pointing out the weakness of the current us administration that lead to this tucker carlson is so damned stupid his elementary school should revoke is graduation  if he is so infatuated with putin he should take his sorry self and depart for moscow forthwith  i think that putins looming threat and johnsons grossly inadequate reaction should bury him  great oped by madeline albright our former secy of state  she knows putin and putin despises her    i think that if putin continues this she foretells that there will be a great war in the world  nailed it biden was supposed to be obamas point on ukraine here we are hunter got rich hillary took millions from ukrainian oligarchs putin invades ukraine biden sanctions americans with more inflation   comment 02242022 trump has been recruited by the russian secret service kgbnow fsb a long time agohouse of trump house of putin  if putin takes ukraine he will come for latvia estonia and lithuania next whats to stop him from going for poland and finland as well  or going back in to any warsaw pacteastern bloc country      fucking hurry up and send the nukes putins long game in ukraine   via   trumpies wake up  paising putin is patrioticif you are a russian or a communistface it you have been rubbing yourselves with trumpoo  you are not usa patriots  youve been dupeddonts manifesto is from everyone take what i can get  dont always has been a taker breaking putin just unfollowed biden on instagram  i disagree with the narrative that putin was surprised by the response of the west i feel this ukraine thing is so existentially important to them they will act regardless of the consequences and those consequences they well knew in advance i truly doubt any surprises here  trump and the gop have been putins tool to weaken americas strength and resolve to defend democracy and the rule of law and to pave the way to destroy democracy in ukraine since july of 2016     also completely predicatble for one of the main thought leaders of todays putintrumpworshiping antiscience pseudochristian qfed seditious antidemocracy ethnonationalist   putin is a killer say followers of criminal george w bush and his neocon crooks 15 million iraqs murdered on lies the justice department in a neighboring city has voted to change their name to the vladimir putin justice department satire  trump was unpredictable and that alone kept putin in check  is the complete opposite  he is exactly the same as clinton bush amp obama they push conflict for their war machine and its the only way to push the economy on a upward tick as they rob the people blind  v putin looks sick puffy features and other symptoms suggest uncontrolled diabetes cancer or tertiary syphilis is he trying to establish a legacy before he is out of time is it a napoleonic complex affecting his personality ask mental health professionals  says putin has a   putin when that boy called    the page in the history book that putin wanted for this war zelensky will get for this speech beautiful strong plainly spoken i hope the russian people get to read it somehow putin is fcking insane there is zero upside to violently attacking ukraine zero but there is an absolute guarantee of catastrophic death and environmental degradation yes discipline and moral at the forward camps is already starting to collapse amongst conscript and unprofessional units if putin is going to act the window is closing    its not selfdetermination when putin draws the lines  putin is in charge right now we lost the tempo greedy ass putin  well they wouldnt want to get in putins way    russia seizing parts of ukraine is a woke distraction warwhy does fox want to do putins bidding and divide america  back to antivaxsigh when invading canada and defending putin didnt pan out  your trying to push back a wild bear with a dam paint rollerits going to get painful amp messy none of us none of us are remotely ready for the war they can and will issue we all have jokes of human beings in charge putin seen trump fgs let alone borris we are sitting ducks the republicans who are praising putin  democratic underground   via    that is a very strange reply to the the tweet that you are responding tothe question was merely asking why the recent support for putinrussia from republicans when they have laughably spent the past forever calling democrats communists  im sorry but youre plainly wrong about putin wanting to join the west and this analysis is so wrong that it shows a complete lack of knowledge of the region  well everyone knows putin is scared of pelosi gop  gulls of putin   putin american embassy provided 1 million a day to maidan protest in kiev  ukrainian industry and jobs gone   ukraine   well you seem think that right wingers praisingdefending putin is not embarrassing so what other conclusion could i make    putin is moving on ukraine bcos biden is slow old amp weak putin smells the weakness of biden would never have acted if trump was in charge but the greenleft media looks the other way  morrison is putins pick  trump slobbering over putin   trump burrows further up putins butt     you and the  have never done anything that wasnt just a partisan hit job when trump owed putin for helping him win the election and just kissed putins a you just kissed trumps a insurrectionist goptraitorstodemocracy    being part is not an issue on putin hegemony is a decrease of tyrants hell gobble up every land if he is allowed to putin even name checked brestlitovsk in his speech the other day and of course cannot forget finland or alaska ukraine president says he tried to call russian president vladimir putin     sheesh bow down to putin much what a patriot
